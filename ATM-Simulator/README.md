# ATM Simulation System (C++)

A desktop ATM simulation system developed in C++ using Embarcadero RAD Studio (C++ Builder).  
This project was created as a university assignment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The application simulates the basic functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).  
It allows users to log into their bank account using a card number and PIN, and perform common banking operations.

The system is based on object-oriented programming principles and file handling mechanisms.

---

## ✨ Features

- User authentication (card number + PIN)
- Balance inquiry
- Cash withdrawal
- Cash deposit
- Transaction history generation
- Multiple user support
- File-based data storage

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++
- Embarcadero RAD Studio (C++ Builder)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling (`fstream`)
- Multi-unit project structure
- VCL form-based interface

## 💾 Data Storage

User accounts and transaction history are stored in text files.  
Transaction history files are generated automatically during program execution.

---

## ▶ How to Run

1. Open the project in Embarcadero RAD Studio (C++ Builder).
2. Ensure that the user data file is available in the project directory.
3. Build and run the project.
